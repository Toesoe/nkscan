/*
 * NKDSBP2.dll proxy — logs NkDriverEntry calls AND SCSI CDBs.
 *
 * NkDriverEntry: __stdcall, 3 params (12 bytes), confirmed from RET 0xc.
 *   int NkDriverEntry(DWORD op, DWORD param2, DWORD param3)
 *
 * SCSI capture: IAT-hooks DeviceIoControl in Nkdsbp2_real.dll ONLY (not the
 * whole process), so only calls originating from the real Nikon transport DLL
 * are intercepted. This avoids the global inline-patch problems seen earlier.
 *
 * For IOCTL_SCSISCAN_CMD (0x190012) the SCSISCAN_CMD control struct carries:
 *   - Cdb[16]        : the SCSI command descriptor block
 *   - Direction      : 0=none, 0x40=IN(device->host), 0x80=OUT(host->device)
 *   - TransferLength : byte count of the data buffer
 *
 * Data-OUT (0x80, e.g. SET WINDOW) bytes are logged BEFORE the call.
 * Data-IN  (0x40, e.g. GET WINDOW / READ) bytes are logged AFTER the call.
 *
 * Overlapped I/O handling:
 *   The Nikon driver issues ALL SCSI commands via overlapped (async) I/O —
 *   DeviceIoControl returns FALSE with ERROR_IO_PENDING. Small transfers
 *   (INQUIRY, GET WINDOW, etc.) complete fast enough that the buffer is
 *   filled by the time our hook reads it. Large transfers (image reads,
 *   376KB-804KB) do NOT complete in time — the DMA is still in flight when
 *   we try to read lpOutBuffer. The fix: after calling realDeviceIoControl,
 *   if the call returned FALSE (pending) and lpOverlapped is provided, we
 *   POLL HasOverlappedIoCompleted(lpOverlapped) (reads OVERLAPPED.Internal,
 *   set directly by the OS) until it flips, instead of waiting on the
 *   completion event ourselves. Waiting on the event would consume it
 *   (auto-reset) or force us to manually re-signal it for the caller —
 *   either way we'd be perturbing a synchronization object the caller also
 *   depends on. Polling never touches it, so the caller's own subsequent
 *   wait on that event behaves exactly as it would against the real DLL.
 *   We also save/restore GetLastError() around all of this — WriteFile,
 *   Sleep, etc. all clobber it as a side effect, and the caller's overlapped
 *   pattern depends on seeing ERROR_IO_PENDING survive on a pending call.
 *   (An earlier version of this fix used WaitForSingleObject + SetEvent and
 *   didn't preserve last-error — it broke device detection entirely: every
 *   SCSI command succeeded, but Nikon Scan saw a clobbered error code after
 *   each one and gave up, reporting "device not found".)
 *
 * Build:
 *   i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -shared -O2 -o NKDSBP2.dll proxy.c \
 *       -lkernel32 -Wl,--enable-stdcall-fixup nkdsbp2.def
